            I specialize in crafting dynamic, responsive UIs using React.js,Redux,
            JavaScript, HTML/CSS.Prioritizing performance and accessibility. But I also embrace the
            backend world, with foundational skills in Java and Spring Boot,
            where Iâ€™ve built RESTful APIs and scalable systems. This dual
            expertise allows me to collaborate effectively across the stack,
            ensuring end-to-end solutions that are both elegant and robust. For
            me, frontend is more than just pixelsâ€”itâ€™s about storytelling
            through design, smooth interactions, and making technology feel
            human. Meanwhile, my backend knowledge helps me appreciate
            architectural decisions, data flow, and how systems come together.{" "}
